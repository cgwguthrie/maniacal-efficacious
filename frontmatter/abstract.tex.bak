\section*{\centering{Abstract}}
The era of Big Data is upon us, bringing with it a range of new challenges, and encouraging the formulation of new approaches for cleaning, processing and using these enormous amounts of data. These new methods have led to the development of a range of technologies designed, to meet the needs of Big Data.

Over the the course of this final year project, I have conducted an investigation into a subset of new technologies which deliver high performance querying of large datasets. I have developed prototype data models using leading NoSQL solutions - MongoDB, Neo4j and Apache Cassandra - and an industry standard relational database management system - MySQL. This project compares and contrasts the functional, performance and analytical capabilities of the different solutions.
