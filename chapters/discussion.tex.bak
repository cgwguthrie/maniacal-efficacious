\chapter{Query Overview, Results and Evaluation}\label{results}
To analyse the functionality of the database systems, I devised a number of queries with ranging difficulties. The aim of the queries was to establish the limitations of the systems, and to discover the efficacy of the systems. A further objective was to identify any extra features the solutions provide which may be useful. For example any visualisations of graphical analysis which may enhance the exploration of the data. Chapter \ref{evaluationstrategy} provides a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the queries. This chapter discusses the output and results of running the queries in the various query languages. This chapter also gives insight into the difficulty of writing the query, the usefulness of the output, the time taken for the query to run and any challenges I faced when throughout the process. Additionally included in this chapter is a general discussion which summarises the capabilities of the systems and aims to provide one with an understanding of the limitations of each of the systems (section  \ref{queryevaluation}).

\section{Query Overview}\label{output}
The screen captures, tables, graphs and charts illustrated in this chapter are based on the results of running the competency based queries on each database system. Table \ref{tab:competency} details each of the devised queries in English, provides a short description of the data expected to be returned and includes a rating characterisation. The rating characterisation ranges from 1 to 5, and while there is no science behind the rating it is to be used as a guide to aid the reader into understanding \textbf{1.} General complexity of the query. \textbf{2.} Fruitfulness of the data returned. \textbf{3.} Level of expectancy that the system will be able to accomplish the query (on a scale of 1 expected, to 5 unexpected).

The order in which I wrote, run and evaluated the queries reflects the complexity of the query itself. I started by implementing simple queries which one would expect each of the systems to successfully achieve. The difficulty of each query increased every time. The end point of this evaluation was when I had written a number of complex queries which would be used to assess the EMAGE dataset in real life scenarios. For example, query number 7 in table \ref{tab:competency} ``Calculate transitive closure''. Finding the hierarchical path of a structure is something which researchers and scientists are often trying to achieve when analysing an anatomy. For example in terms of a human anatomy, the finger is part of the hand which is joined to the wrist which is part of the arm which is joined to the shoulder and so forth. Therefore its inclusion in this examination was necessary. A full description of this query, its origins and output is provided below. 

\begin{table}[H]

\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Query Number} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{English}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Expected return}} & \textbf{Rating} \\ \hline

There are a number of queries one could write which would output potentially interesting results and provide an alternative view of the data. However, the purpose of this examination was to evaluate the functionality of the solutions, assess the limitations of each of the systems and identify any interesting additional features. Thus there was no requirement to include these additional queries which would fail to affect the outcome of the examination.

\section{Query Results}\label{queryresults}
The following subsections provide the results of running the queries outlined in table \ref{tab:competency}. Included in the subsections is the statement written for every system for each of the queries, where I was able to achieve the intended outcome. I have also included the physical output for the first 3 queries. This is to provide the reader with an insight into what is returned from each database solution when running a query. I have only included the output for the first 3 queries as I felt that doing the same process for each query did not add any value to the examination.

At the end of each subsection is a short review of each query, intended to summarise the findings. Section \ref{queryevaluation} provides an in-depth evaluation of the query examination stage of the project as a whole, and compares and contrasts each solution.

\subsection*{Query 1 - All structures at Theiler Stage X}\label{query1}
The first query which I wrote for each of the databases aimed to retrieve the anatomy structure information at a given Theiler Stage. For the basis of these tests I hard coded the Theiler stage; Theiler Stage 4 in this instance.  The minimum amount of data expected to be returned from this query is the structure ID, structure name and Theiler Stage. This query is not complex and one would expect that each database will possess the required functionality to handle this query and return the expected output.

\subsubsection*{MySQL - Query 1 statement}\label{mysqlquery1statement}
The MySQL query shown in code snippet \ref{code:mysqlquery1} successfully returned the expected output. The query was straightforward and only required a single join of the Stages and Anatomy Structures table. I was able to use the ``AS'' keyword to manually define an alias for the column headings of the returned data. The use of this keyword enhances the clarity of the output and allows one to easily identify the data being represented, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:mysqlquery1}. Without the inclusion of the ``AS'' keyword, the headings of the returned data would be the same as the column names in the select statement. For example, ``StructureID'' would be ``AnatomyStructures.accession'' and ``StructureName'' would be ``AnatomyStructures.term''. The official MySQL documentation suggests It is good practice to explicitly use the ``AS'' keyword for all column names \cite{mysqlselectwebsite}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption=MySQL Query 1 statement. All structures at Theiler Stage 4, label=code:mysqlquery1]
SELECT t1.accession AS StructureID, t1.term AS StructureName, t2.theilerstage AS TheilerStage, t2.dpc AS DPC
FROM AnatomyStructures AS t1
INNER JOIN Stages AS t2
ON t1.stage_id = t2.id
WHERE t2.theilerstage = 4
ORDER BY 1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{MySQL - Query 1 output}\label{mysqlquery1output}
Figure \ref{fig:mysqlquery1} is a screen capture of the resulting output from running the MySQL query in the command-line interface. As you can see it returns the data in a table format separated by dashed lines. The number of rows returned and time taken for the query to process is also included below the table.

The output for this query is clear and coherent. However, for this query there is only 4 columns of data being returned. The MySQL command-line tool is run in a machine terminal. The size of the terminal window is at maximum the size of the machines monitor. Thus it is often the case that when returning a large number of columns, the data can become scrambled and illegible.
\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}\includegraphics[height=4cm,width=0.9\linewidth]{images/mysqlquery1}\caption{MySQL command-line tool output - Query 1}\label{fig:mysqlquery1}\end{center}\end{figure}
One way to avoid this is to change the zoom level of the terminal. Depending on the volume of data returned, this can have little to no affect as the further out one zooms, the smaller the font becomes. This can often be a hindrance of using the MySQL command-line tool for advanced queering of large, multicolumn datasets.

\subsubsection*{MongoDB - Query 1 statement}\label{mongoquery1statement}
The MongoDB query shown in code snippet \ref{code:mongoquery1} successfully returned the expected output. The query is much shorter than that of the MySQL query but returns the same data.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption=MongoDB Query 1 statement. All structures at Theiler Stage 4, label=code:mongoquery1]
db.emage.find({
    "stage.theilerstage":4
    },
