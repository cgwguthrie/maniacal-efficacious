Competency Questions for EMAPA:
For structure X, find all the ancestors.
For structure X, find all the decedents.
For structure X, find all structures in the same group (this only
makes sense in limited situations, e.g., find all "hair").
Find all the structures in Theiler Stage X.
Find all the structures in Theiler Stages X to Y (e.g., 17-19).
What stages does structure X appear in?
Given search term X return the "best match" structure (e.g., if I
search on "heart" I would expect the output to be heart, heart atrium,
heart septum  heart mesentery).
Given an EMAPA ID return the name of the structure.
Given a name return the EMAPA ID.

If you also have the EMAP data, you may wish to include:
Given an EMAPA ID retrieve the EMAP ID.
Given an EMAP ID retrieve the EMAPA ID.

CQs for EMAGE:
Where is gene X expressed?
What is expressed in structure X?
Which genes are expressed in both structures X and Y?  (This is
so-called co-expression).
Which genes are most commonly co-expressed? (This is getting towards
BI and is possibly out with the scope of your thesis, but it does no
harm to discuss it.)
