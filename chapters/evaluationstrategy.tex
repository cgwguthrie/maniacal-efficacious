\chapter{Evaluation Strategy}\label{evaluationstrategy}
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the methods used to carry out the primary research for this project. In order to achieve the objectives outlined in section \ref{objectives} a formal set of requirements have been established to meet each intended target. Section \ref{requirements} details how each objective will be evaluated and examples are provided of how each technology will be measured by way of competency questions.

The requirement section below is a high level view of what and how the data solutions will be analysed throughout the project. In order to get a detailed and finalised set of requirements an initial prototype model will be developed which will give an insight in to what will be expected to be achieved from the project. It is likely that the requirements below while they may form the basis of the project objectives will change drastically once the prototype model has been developed.

\section{Requirements}\label{requirements}

\subsubsection*{Objective 1}
\textbf{Evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of each query language.}

The first objective it to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of querying functionality each technology provides. In order to evaluate the functional limitations of each technology, prototype data models will be developed for each solution. The solutions will then be loaded with the EMAPA and EMAGE datasets.

I have created a number of competency based questions. These questions will be translated in to the relevant query language for each of the datasets. The difficulty of the queries range from a basic level, where it is expected that all of the solutions will return the intended output, to an advanced complexity level. The difficulty of writing the queries will be evaluated to assess the overall performance of the database solution.

\subsubsection*{Objective 2}
\textbf{Compare and contrast the analytical capabilities of each technology.}

This will follow on from the tasks undertaken in the first objective. This objective will also identify and analyse the difficulties which may or may not have arisen in the first objective on the ease of writing the query.

\begin{itemize}
\item If the query is possible in a given database how rich a return of the dataset can it provide.
\item Does any database offer any querying capabilities/functionality which compared with another which aids the query in any way.
\item Extra features which the system offers which are useful for analysis and visualisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Objective 3}
\textbf{Assess the scalability of each of the database solutions.}

The final key objective to be evaluated in this project is to conduct a comparative analysis of the scalability of each technology. This will be achieved by loading the data sources in to each prototype data model. The specific requirements which will measure the performance of each database are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ease of ETL implementation - The focus of this requirement will be to evaluate any challenges which were faced during the ETL process.
\item Did the data model handle the volume of data and were there any issues as a result.
\end{itemize}
